# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 2a

This repository contains my solutions to "Homework 2a" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

The homework tasks involve error rate evaluations for baseband systems and include the following:

1. **Modifying a given simulation package**: The task includes examining, running, and modifying a QPSK modulation simulation package to simulate BER and SER performance against both SNR and Eb/N0. The results are explained through graphs.

2. **BPSK Modulation Simulation**: Modification of a given MATLAB Monte-Carlo simulation package to simulate a BPSK transmission system. The task involves plotting and explaining the graph of Eb/N0 vs. BER and comparing it with the QPSK performance.

3. **4-PAM Communication**: Similar to task 2, but for a 4-PAM communication system and the BER plotted against SNR. It requires an understanding of the impact of different mapping methods on the BER performance.

4. **Binary FSK Simulation**: Similar to task 2, but for a binary FSK system.

The repository contains the detailed problem statement (`Homework2a_description.pdf`) along with my proposed solutions (`Homework2a_report.pdf`). The MATLAB code used for each task is also included (`Homework2_code_q1.m`, `Homework2_code_q2.m`, `Homework2_code_q3.m`, `Homework2_code_q4.m`).
