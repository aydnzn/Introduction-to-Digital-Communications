# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 0

This repository is dedicated to "Homework 0: Random Variables/Processes" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

This homework covers a variety of problems based on Random Variables and Processes. The repository contains the detailed problem statement (`Homework0_description.pdf`) along with my proposed solutions (`Homework0_report.pdf`). 

The problems involve:

1. Calculation and sketching of PDF and CDF of a continuous random variable
2. Determination of mean and variance of the random variable
3. Evaluation of joint PDF of a bivariate random variable and its properties
4. Investigation of correlation and independence of two random variables
5. Analysis of the autocorrelation function of a stochastic process
6. Study of the power spectral density and the autocorrelation function of a Gaussian process
7. Examination of a band-limited zero-mean stationary stochastic process and its sampling
8. Analysis of a zero-mean stationary narrowband process and its autocorrelation function
