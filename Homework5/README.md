# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 5

This repository contains my solutions to "Homework 5" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

The homework assignment revolves around the implementation of Viterbi and MMSE equalizers. The task is to design and evaluate these equalizers under three different Inter-symbol Interference (ISI) channel scenarios. We measure the performance of these equalizers using Monte Carlo simulations to ensure that the Bit Error Rate (BER) reaches at least 10^-4.

The repository contains the problem set (`Homework5_description.pdf`), my solutions (`Homework5_report.pdf`), and the MATLAB code I used for each part of the problem (`Homework5_channel1_code.m`, `Homework5_channel2_code.m`, `Homework5_channel3_code.m`).
