# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 2b

This repository contains my solutions to "Homework 2b" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

The homework tasks revolve around error rate evaluations for baseband systems and involve:

1. **Comparative SER and BER Plots for QPSK**: Comparing the SER and BER performances of QPSK as a function of both the SNR and Eb/N0 against their theoretical counterparts.

2. **Comparative BER Plots for BPSK and QPSK**: Comparing the simulated BER performances of QPSK and BPSK along with the theoretical bit error probability curve of BPSK.

3. **Comparative BER Plots for 4-PAM**: Plotting and comparing the simulated BER performances for uniform and grey mappings against their theoretical bit error probability curves.

4. **Comparative BER Plot for BFSK**: Plotting and comparing the simulated BER performance of BFSK with its theoretical bit error probability curve.

5. **16-QAM Simulation**: Modifying a MATLAB Monte-Carlo simulation package to simulate a 16-QAM transmission system. The task involves comparing the BER performances for uniform and grey mappings against their theoretical counterparts.

6. **8-PSK Simulation**: Similar to task 5, but for an 8-PSK communication system.

7. **Comparative BER Plots for All Modulations**: Plotting and comparing the simulated BER curves for all the discussed modulation methods.
