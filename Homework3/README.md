# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 3

This repository contains my solutions to "Homework 3" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

The homework tasks revolve around phase and timing estimation and involve:

1. **Carrier Phase Shift**: Simulating a communication system with a carrier phase shift, designing a receiver that incorporates a decision-directed carrier phase estimate, and plotting phase error against SNR for different values of N.

2. **Symbol Timing Error**: Similar to task 1, but involving a symbol timing error instead of a phase shift. The task involves designing a receiver that incorporates decision-directed maximum likelihood timing estimation.

3. **Timing Error and Phase Shift**: Incorporating a timing error and a delay-induced phase shift, the task involves designing a receiver that incorporates decision-directed joint maximum likelihood timing and phase estimation.

The repository contains the detailed problem statement (`Homework3_description.pdf`).
