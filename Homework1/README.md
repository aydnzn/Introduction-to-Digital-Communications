# Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 1

This repository is dedicated to "Homework 1" for the course "Introduction to Digital Communications".

## Description

The homework includes the following tasks:

1. **MATLAB Coding**: Modulate a given bit stream, s, with various modulation schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 4-PAM, 16-QAM, Binary FSK). For each modulation scheme, provide the constellation diagram, sinusoidal waveforms to represent the symbols, and the modulated pulse stream.

2. **Vector Analysis**: Find an orthonormal basis for a set of given vectors and express the vectors in terms of this basis. Then find an orthonormal basis for these vectors using the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization method and express the vectors in terms of this new basis.

The repository contains the detailed problem statement (`Homework1_description.pdf`) along with my proposed solutions (`Homework1_report.pdf`). The MATLAB code used for the first task is also included (`Homework1_code.m`).
