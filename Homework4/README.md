# EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications - Homework 4

This repository contains my solutions to "Homework 4" for the course "EE 477: Introduction to Digital Communications" offered in Fall 2018.

## Description

The homework tasks focus on channel equalization in communication systems. It involves designing several types of equalizers: Zero-Forcing Equalizers (ZFE), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers, and Decision-Feedback Equalizers (DFE). The performance of these equalizers is evaluated in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) under three different channel scenarios. The simulation requires a careful setup to ensure that the BER reaches a level of at least 10^-4.

The repository contains the detailed problem statement (`Homework4_description.pdf`).
